MENTOR: MUZAMMIL AHMED

Project: Weather Monitoring Station

Objective

Create an IoT-based system to collect and display real-time data on temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure via a mobile app.

Key Activities

Integrate temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors with an ESP8266/ESP32 microcontroller. Develop firmware to send sensor data to a Firebase cloud database. Build a mobile app using MIT App Inventor to display the data in real-time. Test the system for accuracy and reliability, deploy the hardware, and maintain the system with regular updates and support.

Technologies Used

Sensors (DHT22, BMP280), microcontroller (ESP8266/ESP32), Firebase for cloud storage, MIT App Inventor for the mobile app, and Wi-Fi for data transmission.

Key Insights

Ensure accurate sensor data collection and secure data transmission. Provide real-time data on an intuitive mobile app. Regularly update and maintain the system for consistent performance and user satisfaction.
